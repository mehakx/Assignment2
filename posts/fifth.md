In an era where everything feels performative and curated, where social media rewards the most polished versions of ourselves, and where algorithms amplify what gets engagement over what feels genuine—how do we remain authentic? We live in times that seem to systematically reward inauthenticity, where being real can feel like a competitive disadvantage.

The challenge isn't just external pressure to perform, but internal confusion about what authenticity even means. When our desires are culturally conditioned, when we've adapted to "baseline normals" that feel wrong, when we can't articulate what's missing—how do we find that deep thing in us that feels truly ours? Authenticity in inauthentic times requires stripping back the layers of what we think we should want to discover what we actually need.

What would it look like to live authentically in a world designed to make us perform?
