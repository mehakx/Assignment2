Our relationship with time has fundamentally shifted in the digital age. We scroll through hours without awareness, lose ourselves in endless feeds, and find our personal boundaries constantly invaded by notifications, alerts, and the persistent hum of connectivity. The very devices meant to save us time have become time thieves, stealing our attention in micro-doses throughout the day.

Digital boundaries aren't just about screen time limits—they're about reclaiming agency over our temporal experience. When we can scroll TikTok for four hours and not know where the time went, when information overload leaves us overwhelmed and unable to make choices, when technology isolates us despite promising connection, we've lost more than time. We've lost our sense of presence, our ability to be fully where we are, when we are.

How do we establish healthy boundaries with technology that honors both our need for connection and our need for presence?
